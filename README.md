# Sorting Algorithms Comparative Analysis
Program compares the relative performance of different sorting algorithms on datasets containing  integers. 
Ultimately, the data sorted in ascending order. Program tested on two different array sizes: 100 and 1000.

The following random number distributions are used:
- Completely random
- Almost sorted in ascending order (about 90% of the items are in increasing order, 10% are random)
- Almost reversed -  same as b) but in reverse order
- Array is sorted except for the last 10%

The following sorting algorithms are used:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
